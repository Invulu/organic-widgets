A collection of 12 custom widgets to use within the customizer. Display and arrange them as various types of full width content sections on any page.

== Description ==

Display and arrange custom widgets as full width content sections on any page — such as post slideshows, testimonials, team members, portfolios, feature lists, pricing tables products and more. The widgets are designed to work with virtually any theme or page builder that uses widgets.

Organic Customizer Widgets introduces several widgets for displaying content in new ways. It includes a new page template, that when applied, creates a new widget area on that page. This allows the core WordPress customizer to be used like a page builder by adding widgets as content sections to any page. Each widget includes basic styles, but will otherwise inherit styles from the active theme.

1. Add a new page under *Pages > Add New*.

3. Click the 'Customize Page' button.
4. Within the Customizer, Click the 'Add a Widget' button.
5. Begin adding Organic widgets to the page.

== Installation ==

Note: This plugin relies on new WordPress features, so it requires WordPress version 4.8+ and PHP 5.3.29+

1. Upload 'organic-customizer-widgets' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Apply the 'Organic Custom' template to the desired page
4. Click 'Customize Page' in the page editor, navigate to the customizer ('Appearance > Widgets'), or the widgets page ('Appearance > Widgets') to add widgets to the page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: Why would I use Organic Customizer Widgets over other page builders? =

A: The Organic Customizer Widgets plugin utilizes the core WordPress Customizer and native widget functionality, rather than relying on proprietary code. Therefore, it's faster, easier and more secure to build dynamic pages for your site using Organic Customizer Widgets. Additionally, the plugin is compatible with almost any theme, and there is no vendor lock-in.

= Q: How do I start customizing a page with the Organic Customizer Widgets? =

A: Simply assign the "Organic Custom" page template to a page and save it. This will create a new Widget Area named after the page. You can then add widgets to this widget area via the WordPress Customizer (recommended) or the Widgets page in the WordPress Admin. The Organic Widgets have been designed to function as page sections, but you can also add core WordPress widgets.

= Q: Can I use Organic Customizer Widgets with themes other than Organic Themes? =

A: Yes, the custom widget areas and widgets will transfer between themes. The widgets contain basic styling so that they should work with most themes. That said, the widgets will look best on sites using Organic Themes, as they're designed with the plugin in mind. Custom CSS can be used to override the default styles to customize the content to fit your needs.

= Q: How can I get widgets to group together into a single page section? =

A: Groupable widgets (Profiles, Pricing Tables and Featured Content) will group together when placed consecutively in a widget area. A colored border on the left side of the widget panel will indicate which widgets have been grouped together.

= Q: Can I use the Organic Customizer Widgets in other widget areas, like sidebars and footers? =

A: Most of the Organic Widgets are designed to be used as full-width sections on a page, but depending on your theme styles they may work in other areas as well.
