Transform the core WordPress Customizer into a page builder. Display and arrange widgets on any page as beautiful content sections, such as featured content slideshows, testimonials, team members, portfolios, feature lists, pricing tables and more. Whoa, cool.

## Description

Organic Customizer Widgets introduces several widgets that can be used for displaying existing page content or custom content in new ways. It includes a new Page Template, that when applied, creates a new widget area and displays that on the page. This allows users to utilize WordPress' core customizer interface to add widgets to their page, displaying them as page sections without the need for shortcodes or page builders. The widgets include basic styles, but will inherit styles from whichever theme is being used.

## Installation

Note: This plugin relies on new WordPress features, so it requires WordPress version 4.8+ and PHP 5.6+

1. Upload `organic-widgets` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Apply the `Organic Custom` template to the desired page
4. Click `Customize Page` in the page editor, navigate to the customizer (`Appearance > Widgets`), or the widgets page (`Appearance > Widgets`) to add widgets to the page.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How do I start customizing a page with the Organic Widgets?

A: Simply assign the "Organic Custom" page template to a page and save it. This will create a new Widget Area named after the page. You can then add widgets to this widget area via the WordPress Customizer (recommended) or the Widgets page in the WordPress Admin. The Organic Widgets have been designed to function as page sections, but you can also add other widgets as desired!

Q: Can I use the custom widgets with themes other than Organic Themes?

A: Yes, the custom widget areas and widgets will transfer between themes. The widgets contain basic styling so that they should work with most themes. That said, the widgets will look best on sites using Organic Themes, as they're designed with the plugin in mind. Custom CSS can always be used to override our default styles to customize the content to fit your needs.

Q: How can I get widgets to group together into a single page section?

A: Groupable widgets (Profiles, Pricing Tables and Featured Content) will group together when placed consecutively in a widget area. A colored border on the left side of the widget panel will indicate which widgets have been grouped together.

Q: Can I use the Organic Widgets in other widget areas, like sidebars and footers?

A: Most of the Organic Widgets are designed to be used as full-width sections on a page, but depending on your theme's styles, they may work in other areas too.
