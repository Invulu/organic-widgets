## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How do I start customizing a page with the Organic Widgets?

A: Simply assign the "Organic Custom" page template to a page and save it. This will create a new Widget Area named after the page. You can then add widgets to this widget area via the WordPress Customizer (recommended) or the Widgets page in the WordPress Admin. The Organic widgets have been designed to function as page sections, but you can also add other widgets as desired!

Q: Can I use the custom widgets with themes other than Organic Themes?

A: Yes, the custom widget areas and widgets will transfer between themes. The widgets will look best on sites using Organic Themes, as they are designed with the plugin in mind, but the widgets contain basic styling so that they should work with most other themes as well. Custom CSS or child themes can be used to override the default styles.

Q: How can I get widgets to group together into a single page section?

A: Groupable widgets (Profiles, Pricing Tables and Featured Content) will group together when placed consecutively in a widget area. A colored border on the left side of the widget will indicate which widgets have been grouped together.

Q: Can I use the Organic Widgets in other widget areas, like sidebars and footers?

A: The Organic Widgets are designed to be used as full-width sections on a page, but they should work in other areas too.
